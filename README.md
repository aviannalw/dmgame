This is a video game about data management.
This repository was developed in the spring of 2024, and began as a master's thesis project. As of May 23, 2024, Data Voyager is ready for export and playtesting.
The project file is named "Practice_RPG". Editing the project file name on GameMaker should be considered with great care, as it may disrupt the repository changes. Though it is inconsistent wih game branding, we recommend keeping this file name until the game is exported for users.
GameMaker Studio is required to edit the game, which operates on Mac and PC systems. The version used during initial development was v2023.11.1.129.
